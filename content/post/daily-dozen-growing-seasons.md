I've recently come across a set of nutritional guidelines that have more clarity in them than any other I've read: [Dr Gerber's Daily Dozen](https://youtu.be/MqmSMunAtss). While I'm not ready to follow Dr Gerber and go full vegan - or even fully vegetarian - it is nice to have a list of healthy foods and minimum servings to strive for each day.

Dr Gerber also has a handy app for tracking your consumption of each item of the Daily Dozen. It has a handy checklist, a list of suggested foods, portion sizes, and even some basic statistics of how many you regularly knock off the list.

One thing missing in the Daily Dozen app though, is information as to when each suggested item is available in the year. Knowing the seasonality of produce is something I've never been good at. So I decided to research each of the items on the Daily Dozen to brush up on that knowledge.

Here's what I've found:
