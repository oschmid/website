        <li>Modern Monetary Theory argues for a <a href="http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=41399">Job
            Guarantee</a>: a government program that will hire anyone who wants a job and find one for them. The
            specific job is low skilled, minimum wage, and depends on community needs. This usually means work that isn&rsquo;t
            profitable for the private sector and doesn't fall easily under current definitions of public sector
            and can include such areas as community, environmental, or infrastructure improvement.
