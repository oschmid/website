    <p>This November BC voters have the duty and opportunity to vote on how we vote. This is BC&rsquo;s third referendum
        on voting reform, and also the one with the most options.</p>
    <h3 id="what-voting-systems-is-bc-choosing-between">What voting systems is BC choosing between?</h3>
    <p>The first question of the referendum is between keeping the current system: known as First-Past-The-Post (FPTP)
        and switching to a Proportional Representation voting system. The second question BC voters will be asked is to
        rank 3 PR systems. Mail-in ballots will be mailed out between Oct 22 and Nov 2.</p>
    <h3 id="what-is-proportional-representation">What is Proportional Representation?</h3>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation">Proportional Representation</a> systems try
        to guarantee that if 70% of votes in BC are for party A, 70% of BC’s legislature is filled with MLAs from party
        A.</p>
    <h3 id="what-are-the-pros-and-cons-for-proportional-representation">What are the pros and cons for Proportional
        Representation?</h3>
    <p>The official proponent of PR is <a
            href="https://fairvotingbc.com/join-the-campaign-for-fair-voting/why-voting-reform/what-the-evidence-says/">Fair
        Voting BC</a>. The official opposition is <a href="https://nobcprorep.ca/">No ProRep BC</a>. The opposition site
        has more catchphrases than arguments… so here’s a stronger summary of <a
                href="https://www.rangevoting.org/PropRep.html">arguments against PR</a> (see the PR minuses).</p>

    <p>Watch this video for a <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1276710979863/">quick explanation of the 3 types of
        proportional voting systems</a> on B.C.&rsquo;s ballot</p>
    <h3 id="how-do-they-compare-to-each-other">How do they compare to each other?</h3>
    <p>The best comparison of these voting systems is the <a href="https://fairvotingbc.com/scorecard/">Fair Voting BC
        Scorecard</a>. I highly recommend reading through it and weighing the different pros and cons of each system
        yourself.</p>
    <h3 id="what-will-you-vote-for">What will you vote for?</h3>
    <p>I’m in favour of Proportional Representation. Based on the scorecard my ranking of the 3 proposed PR systems
        is:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Mixed Member Proportional (simple ballot, and you can vote on individual candidates)</li>
        <li>Dual Member Proportional (simple ballot, but you only pick the party, they pick which of multiple candidates
            it counts towards)
        </li>
        <li>Rural-Urban Proportional (Single Transferable Vote lets you vote for individual candidates but ranking a
            dozen candidates is hard)
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="if-you-had-the-option-to-pick-a-different-voting-system-entirely-what-would-you-pick">If you had the option to
        pick a different voting system entirely, what would you pick?</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.rangevoting.org/RangeVoting.html">Range Voting</a>. It doesn't have Proportional
        Representation but it has other <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1382574.Gaming_the_Vote">benefits</a>
        (it’s expressive, resistant to vote splitting, incentivizes honest voting, neither pro-centrist nor
        pro-extremist).</p>
    <p>Actually, there’s a version of range voting that does have Proportional Representation called <a
            href="https://www.rangevoting.org/RRV.html">Re-Weighted Range Voting</a> that looks interesting. But that’s
        for another day.</p>
