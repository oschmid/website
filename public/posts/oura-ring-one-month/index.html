    I&rsquo;ve been using the new <a href="https://ouraring.com/">Oura ring</a> sleep tracker for a little over a
        month now. It&rsquo;s exactly the kind of wearable I&rsquo;m a fan of: invisible, reliable, and focused. It
        looks like any normal ring, it&rsquo;s tough and its battery lasts a week, and (unlike other devices) it isn&rsquo;t
        a distraction because it only tries to do one thing: measure your recovery.</p>
    <p>The ring data seems pretty reliable and the fact that it summarizes all the different measurements into 3 daily
        scores (Sleep, Readiness, and Activity) is handy. I try to assess how rested I feel each day before checking the
        app and the app does seem to give better scores on days I feel better and worse scores on days I feel worse.</p>
    <p>The ring has also pointed out a couple areas I could work on to improve my sleep. I plan on tracking these
        measures over time to see if I can get them up.</p>
    <p>While activity tracking isn&rsquo;t a huge focus for Oura, I like the fact that the goal changes each day
        depending on my Readiness score. On days when I&rsquo;m not rested, the number of active calories it sets as my
        goal is lower than on days when I am rested. This makes more sense than an inflexible &ldquo;10,000 steps a day
        &ndash; every day&rdquo; type of goal.</p>
    <p>The one technical issue I&rsquo;ve run into is that the Android app sometimes can&rsquo;t find the ring. This
        only seems to happen if I have the app open earlier in the day but then keep it open in the background for a
        while. Closing and restarting the app fixes it though.</p>
    <p>Along with the app, Oura also has an online platform called <a href="https://cloud.ouraring.com">Oura Cloud</a>
        that lets you do more fine-tuned analysis of your data. For instance, you can compare your Bedtime Start with
        your total Deep Sleep Time for each night to see if something jumps out.</p>
    <p>The problem with Oura Cloud though, is that none of the notes or activities manually tagged in the app are
        available for comparison. So I can&rsquo;t use it to see for instance, how much of an effect taking melatonin
        might have on my sleep.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve emailed Oura about this, and they say they are planning to make notes and activities available in Oura
        Cloud, but they didn't specify a timeline. Hopefully they can release that feature soon though because
        there isn&rsquo;t even a way to bulk export notes and activities through the <a
                href="https://cloud.ouraring.com/docs/">Oura API</a>.</p>
    <p>Overall I&rsquo;m pretty happy with the Oura ring and plan to keep using it to improve my sleep. That&rsquo;s it
        for the review portion of this post.</p>
    <h2 id="user-guide">User Guide</h2>
    <p>These are some useful bits of information I&rsquo;ve looked up and wanted to write down in one place.</p>
    <h4 id="how-tough-is-it">How tough is it?</h4>
    <p>It&rsquo;s made of <a
            href="https://help.ouraring.com/about-the-new-oura-ring/important-information-about-product-safety">titanium
        with a DLC or PVC coating</a> and <a
            href="https://help.ouraring.com/about-the-new-oura-ring/the-oura-ring-materials">waterproof to at least
        100m</a>. That&rsquo;s good enough to take it on most recreational dives!</p>
    <p>The Oura ring is also hardy enough to operate in anything from an ice bath to a hot sauna (<a
            href="https://help.ouraring.com/about-the-new-oura-ring/important-information-about-product-safety">-10째C
        &ndash; 54째C</a>). This stands to reason: the ring was made in Finland after all. (It also handles hot tubs and
        hot yoga without a problem.)</p>
    <h4 id="how-about-the-battery">How about the battery?</h4>
    <p>The LiPo battery has between <a
            href="https://help.ouraring.com/about-the-new-oura-ring/important-information-about-product-safety">15mAh
        &ndash; 22mAh</a> (depending on your ring size: US6 &ndash; US13). It is recommended to <a
            href="https://ouraring.com/pre-order-update-3-questions-and-answers/">charge the battery to 100% as often as
        possible</a>.</p>
    <h4 id="how-much-emf-output-does-it-give">How much EMF output does it give?</h4>
    <p>The SAR (specific absorption rate) level allowed for a device like the Oura ring is 2.0W/kg for the head and body.
        The Oura ring&rsquo;s <a
                href="https://help.ouraring.com/about-the-new-oura-ring/radio-frequency-electromagnetic-field-emf-and-bluetooth">SAR
            level is 0.0003W/kg</a>. The light emitted by the sensors is also in the infra-red band, something known to
        be healthy rather than harmful.</p>
    <p>There&rsquo;s also an airplane mode if you&rsquo;re really worried about EMF emission. Though the ring emits only
        about <a
                href="https://help.ouraring.com/about-the-new-oura-ring/radio-frequency-electromagnetic-field-emf-and-bluetooth">1mW</a>
        while some cellphones peak out at about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBm">1000mW</a>.</p>
    <h4 id="how-does-the-3-crown-scoring-system-work">How does the 3 crown scoring system work?</h4>
    <p>The Oura ring gives you a crown if you score <a
            href="https://help.ouraring.com/getting-started/what-does-the-crown-stand-for">over 85% in Sleep, Readiness,
        Activity</a>. In the calendar view of the app, the 3 crowns are shown top down in that same order: Sleep at the
        top, Readiness in the middle, and Activity at the bottom.</p>
    <p>Sleep scores are based on data from your last night&rsquo;s sleep. Readiness and Activity are both based on data
        from several days.</p>
    <h4 id="how-do-i-find-my-ideal-bedtime">How do I find my ideal bedtime?</h4>
    <p>After the few weeks that it needs to learn your habits, the Oura app starts showing a window of time when it
        suggests you go to bed. This is the <a
                href="https://ouraring.com/how-to-find-your-ideal-bedtime-with-the-oura-app/">window of time when you
            seem to score the best sleep</a>. Stick to this bedtime as much as possible for improved sleep.</p>
    <p>There are other many other factors that can affect sleep. Consider:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Turning off your devices in the hour before bedtime (read a book instead!)</li>
        <li>Blacking out all light sources in your bedroom or wearing an eye mask</li>
        <li>Cooling your room to <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/the-right-temperature-for-good-sleep/">15째C
            &ndash;
            19째C</a></li>
        <li>Eliminating disturbing noises with earplugs</li>
        <li>Stretching out your spine before bed with some relaxing yoga poses</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Oura is involved in a <a
            href="https://chriskresser.com/how-to-use-tech-to-improve-your-sleep-with-harpreet-rai/">sleep
        study of hunter&ndash;gatherers</a>. Hopefully when that study is published there will be even more interesting
        tips for getting better sleep.</p>
